Algorithms reward outrage, and disinformation campaigns stoke panic. The result is a constant barrage of content designed to make us click, share, and worry. Here&rsquo;s a clearer look at the facts - and some simple ways you can fight back.</p><figure class=image-center><img src=https://xvnpw.github.io/aohaf-1.png width=400></figure><h2 id=hate-in-the-news-feed>Hate in the News Feed</h2><ul><li>In 2018, Facebook researchers found that posts triggering the &ldquo;angry&rdquo; reaction were shown about five times more often than those earning a simple &ldquo;like.&rdquo;</li><li>The Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified that Facebook&rsquo;s algorithm favored content that elicited strong emotional reactions, which often included outrage.</li><li>A 2020 New York University study found that Facebook pages known for disseminating misinformation - including some featuring extremist or hateful content - garnered up to six times more interactions than reputable news sources of comparable size.</li></ul><p>When hate drives more comments, shares, and time spent, the platform&rsquo;s bottom line benefits - even if trust and civility suffer.</p><h2 id=fear-in-the-wild>Fear in the Wild</h2><ul><li>U.S. intelligence agencies reported that Russia&rsquo;s Internet Research Agency operated over 30,000 fake social-media accounts during the 2016 election, reaching at least 126 million Facebook users.</li><li>EUvsDisinfo, the EU&rsquo;s fact-checking project, has documented more than 15,000 Kremlin-linked falsehoods since 2015. Common themes: &ldquo;the West is collapsing,&rdquo; &ldquo;vaccines are dangerous,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ukraine is run by Nazis.&rdquo;</li><li>A study by the Oxford Internet Institute revealed that, among a sample of 1.3 million Twitter accounts tweeting about Russian politics between 2014 and 2015, nearly 45% were identified as automated bots actively amplifying pro-Kremlin narratives.</li></ul><p>Fear hijacks our survival instinct. A scary headline makes us click and share before we pause to verify.</p><h2 id=why-these-emotions-dominate-now>Why These Emotions Dominate Now</h2><ul><li>Infinite reach: A single post can hit millions in seconds.</li><li>Instant feedback: Outrage and panic earn quick likes and shares, which algorithms interpret as high-quality content.</li><li>Low friction: It&rsquo;s easy to share before fact-checking or finishing the article.</li></ul><h2 id=the-brain-chemistry-at-work>The Brain Chemistry at Work</h2><p>Why is it so difficult to look away? Two chemicals play a big role:</p><ul><li>Cortisol - the &ldquo;stress hormone.&rdquo; Rapid-fire updates and heated arguments raise our cortisol levels, making us anxious yet hyper-focused. This vigilance keeps us scrolling and searching for more.</li><li>Dopamine - the &ldquo;reward hormone.&rdquo; A colorful news feed, comments, and catchy titles trigger tiny hits of dopamine. Each like or share can feel like a mini-reward, forming a habit loop that&rsquo;s hard to break.</li></ul><p>Colorful visuals and clickbait headlines heighten these responses further. Flashy graphics, sensational language, and dramatic images lure us in like a carnival barker - promising excitement if we just click one more time.</p><h2 id=strategies-to-push-back>Strategies to Push Back</h2><h3 id=against-hate>Against Hate</h3><ul><li>Slow the Scroll - Pause before reacting. Ask, ‚ÄúWho benefits if I blow up right now?‚Äù</li><li>Curate Consciously - Unfollow or mute pages full of insults and dehumanizing language. Seek out sources that rely on evidence and balanced reporting.</li><li>Go Offline - Tough conversations are better face-to-face. Research shows in-person discussions are less likely to spiral into hostility.</li></ul><h3 id=against-fear>Against Fear</h3><ul><li>Triple-Source Everything - Only trust alarming news if two reputable outlets have confirmed it. If not, treat it as rumor.</li><li>Set News Windows - Allocate specific times to catch up on current events instead of doom-scrolling all day.</li><li>Build Real-World Ties - Join local activities or community organizations. In-person connections offer balanced perspectives bots can&rsquo;t provide.</li></ul><h3 id=more-strategies>More Strategies</h3><ul><li>Shift to a Basic Phone - Eliminating or drastically reducing push notifications can cut stress levels. Fewer apps and distractions keep you from spiraling into outrage or fear-driven social feeds.</li><li>Embrace Microlearning - Use educational apps to build new skills and habits. Platforms offering short lessons - like language apps or quick tutorials - reward curiosity rather than anxiety. It&rsquo;s an easy way to spend downtime productively while steering clear of inflammatory media.</li></ul><h2 id=bottom-line>Bottom Line</h2><p>Algorithms and shadowy actors turn hate and fear into high-speed, high-profit commodities. By understanding how they work - and by pausing, curating, and reconnecting in real life - you reclaim control over your feed and your emotions.</p><p>üôè Share, to spread the word.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/politics>politics</a></li><li><a href=/tags/society>society</a></li><li><a href=/tags/hate>hate</a></li><li><a href=/tags/fear>fear</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/xvnpw rel=me title=GitHub><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#github"/></svg></a><a class=border></a><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/xvnpw rel=me title=Twitter><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#twitter"/></svg></a><a class=border></a><a class=soc href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcin-niemiec-304349104/ rel=me title=Linkedin><svg class="feather"><use href="/svg/feather-sprite.51cf5647cb1987f769b616558f2620fd9423d72058490231b391bf6aa3744b55.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a><a class=border></a></div><div class=footer-info>2025 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-YHETMXZXMZ"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-YHETMXZXMZ")}</script></div></body></html>
