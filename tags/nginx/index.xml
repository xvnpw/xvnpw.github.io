It was origin story for other investigations regarding insecure usage of $request_uri which leaded to Apache APISIX CVE-2021-43557. I have started with report on HackerOne to Kubernetes project: https://hackerone.com/reports/1357948. It took long time for the team to investigate it, but in the end I got some bounty üòè sadly report was closed as informative.</description></item><item><title>Hunting for buggy authentication/authorization services on github</title><link>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/hunting_for_buggy_authentication_authorization_services_on_github/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 10:58:59 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/hunting_for_buggy_authentication_authorization_services_on_github/</guid><description>To successful bypass access control using path traversal in $request_uri, you need to have buggy authentication/authorization service. Buggy in a way it&amp;rsquo;s not normalizing url/uri that is part of access control decision. Let me find more of those on github that are relying on X-Original-Url. There is high chance that this header is populated from $request_uri variable and not protected in any way.

APIs This vulnerability is for APIs. Best scenario are microservice deployed to Kubernetes and exposed by ingress controller.
Using paths API that you are playing with, need to use paths to address services, e.g.:
OK! https://api.example.com/user-service https://api.example.com/customer-service ... NOT OK! https://user.example.com/ https://customer.example.com/ First set of URLs is good for exploitation, as you can try sending request with https://api.</description></item></channel></rss>
