In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my latest findings with Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, one of the newest advanced models, and reflect on how AI systems have evolved during this period. More importantly, I&amp;rsquo;ll examine whether they&amp;rsquo;re fulfilling their initial promise for security threat modeling applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As with my previous research, the goal is to assess how effectively LLMs can assist in threat modeling. For this, I used a deliberately underspecified architecture for a fictional project: &amp;ldquo;AI Nutrition Pro&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Deep Analysis Mode in AI Security Analyzer</title><link>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/ai-security-analyzer-deep-analysis-mode/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2025 20:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/ai-security-analyzer-deep-analysis-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p>First off, &lt;strong>a big thank you&lt;/strong> ðŸ™‡ to everyone who provided such positive feedback on my previous post, &lt;a href="https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/scaling-threat-modeling-with-ai/">Scaling Threat Modeling with AI: Generating 1000 Threat Models Using Gemini 2.0 and AI Security Analyzer&lt;/a>. Your insights and suggestions have been incredibly valuable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inspired by your comments, I&amp;rsquo;ve added a new feature to the AI Security Analyzer: &lt;strong>Deep Analysis Mode&lt;/strong>. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll walk you through how it works and showcase its capabilities using Google&amp;rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model to perform an in-depth threat modeling on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">Flask&lt;/a> project. We&amp;rsquo;ll compare outputs between Normal Mode and Deep Analysis Mode to highlight the differences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scaling Threat Modeling with AI: Generating 1000 Threat Models Using Gemini 2.0 and AI Security Analyzer</title><link>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/scaling-threat-modeling-with-ai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 12:19:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/scaling-threat-modeling-with-ai/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Can AI help us scale security analysis?&amp;rdquo; This question led me down a fascinating path of experimenting with Google&amp;rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 to generate threat models at an unprecedented scale. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share how I turned this ambitious idea into reality, complete with code samples, real outputs, and valuable lessons learned along the way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Security documentation is crucial but often becomes a bottleneck in fast-moving development cycles. With the release of Google&amp;rsquo;s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model, I saw an opportunity to tackle this challenge head-on, despite some notable limitations:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
