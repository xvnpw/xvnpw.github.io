What is Threat Modeling? There are many definitions, but for me it's a technique to find security problems before implementation happend. What is before implementation you may ask? Creating a **design**. Sometimes it's very simple as drawoing few boxes and arrows among them. **It's enought**, it's only a model, it's wrong, but it can be usefull.
