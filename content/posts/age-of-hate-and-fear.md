I decided to write this post to be yet another reminder how current world is influencing our emotions and behavior.

We live in an era where two powerful emotions - hate and fear - are amplified online. Algorithms reward outrage, and disinformation campaigns stoke panic. The result is a constant barrage of content designed to make us click, share, and worry. Here's a clearer look at the facts - and some simple ways you can fight back.

## Hate in the News Feed
- In 2018, Facebook researchers found that posts triggering the "angry" reaction were shown about five times more often than those earning a simple "like."
- The Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen testified that Facebook's algorithm favored content that elicited strong emotional reactions, which often included outrage.
- A 2020 New York University study found that Facebook pages known for disseminating misinformation - including some featuring extremist or hateful content - garnered up to six times more interactions than reputable news sources of comparable size."

When hate drives more comments, shares, and time spent, the platform's bottom line benefits - even if trust and civility suffer.

## Fear in the Wild
- U.S. intelligence agencies reported that Russia's Internet Research Agency operated over 30,000 fake social-media accounts during the 2016 election, reaching at least 126 million Facebook users.
- EUvsDisinfo, the EU's fact-checking project, has documented more than 15,000 Kremlin-linked falsehoods since 2015. Common themes: "the West is collapsing," "vaccines are dangerous," and "Ukraine is run by Nazis."
- A study by the Oxford Internet Institute revealed that, among a sample of 1.3 million Twitter accounts tweeting about Russian politics between 2014 and 2015, nearly 45% were identified as automated bots actively amplifying pro-Kremlin narratives.

Fear hijacks our survival instinct. A scary headline makes us click and share before we pause to verify.

## Why These Emotions Dominate Now
- Infinite reach: A single post can hit millions in seconds.
- Instant feedback: Outrage and panic earn quick likes and shares, which algorithms interpret as high-quality content.
- Low friction: It's easy to share before fact-checking or finishing the article.

## The Brain Chemistry at Work

Why is it so difficult to look away? Two chemicals play a big role:

- Cortisol - the "stress hormone." Rapid-fire updates and heated arguments raise our cortisol levels, making us anxious yet hyper-focused. This vigilance keeps us scrolling and searching for more.
- Dopamine - the "reward hormone." A colorful news feed, comments, and catchy titles trigger tiny hits of dopamine. Each like or share can feel like a mini-reward, forming a habit loop that's hard to break.

Colorful visuals and clickbait headlines heighten these responses further. Flashy graphics, sensational language, and dramatic images lure us in like a carnival barker - promising excitement if we just click one more time.

## Strategies to Push Back

### Against Hate
- Slow the Scroll - Pause before reacting. Ask, ‚ÄúWho benefits if I blow up right now?‚Äù
- Curate Consciously - Unfollow or mute pages full of insults and dehumanizing language. Seek out sources that rely on evidence and balanced reporting.
- Go Offline - Tough conversations are better face-to-face. Research shows in-person discussions are less likely to spiral into hostility.

### Against Fear
- Triple-Source Everything - Only trust alarming news if two reputable outlets have confirmed it. If not, treat it as rumor.
- Set News Windows - Allocate specific times to catch up on current events instead of doom-scrolling all day.
- Build Real-World Ties - Join local activities or community organizations. In-person connections offer balanced perspectives bots can't provide.

### More Strategies
- Shift to a Basic Phone - Eliminating or drastically reducing push notifications can cut stress levels. Fewer apps and distractions keep you from spiraling into outrage or fear-driven social feeds.
- Embrace Microlearning - Use educational apps to build new skills and habits. Platforms offering short lessons - like language apps or quick tutorials - reward curiosity rather than anxiety. It's an easy way to spend downtime productively while steering clear of inflammatory media.

## Bottom Line

Algorithms and shadowy actors turn hate and fear into high-speed, high-profit commodities. By understanding how they work - and by pausing, curating, and reconnecting in real life - you reclaim control over your feed and your emotions.
