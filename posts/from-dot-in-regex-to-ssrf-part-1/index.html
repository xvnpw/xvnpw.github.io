Way of finding it was huge fun and excitement. It was also my first bug on production system ever.</p><p>During a recon I have found service called <em>image-converter</em>. It was definitely interesting, but not straight forward to exploit. I had no example of usage it and on simple GET request I was just getting:</p><figure><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17719543/139576933-06cadc0d-6489-4ac1-8e58-292d5fb1baf8.png></figure><p>That was first major problem for me. I was trying with some simple query parameters like:</p><ul><li><code>?url=</code></li><li><code>?width=</code></li><li><code>?name=</code></li></ul><p>and so on but without luck. Then I tried with <a href=https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun>https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun</a> which is tool for automated parameter discovery. This also failed. I was pretty sure that there is something out there, but I couldn&rsquo;t force it to work.</p><p>Then I started digging in what is this error message that I see all the time: <code>"Cannot read property 'groups' of null"</code>. This leads me to stackoverflow question about JavaScript and regex error. After that I was wondering: &ldquo;How the hell they have implemented this?&rdquo;. After hour of trying and failure, I got it:</p><p><code>https://api.example.org/image-converter/width=100/http://google.com</code></p><figure><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17719543/139577018-2487fddb-ef0a-449b-a893-7ad929e4aa0b.png></figure><p>In my almost 10 years IT career, I didn&rsquo;t see service implementation like thatÂ ðŸ˜‰</p><p>My positive energy went down, as I realized that there is domain whitelisting implemented. I have picked main domain <code>www.example.org</code> and in fact it was working:</p><p><code>https://api.example.org/image-converter/width=100/https://www.example.org</code></p><p>I got response:</p><figure><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17719543/139577079-083fd93f-3679-4487-9f91-4d7f8fec6be8.png></figure><p>In this moment I was sure about SSRF, but still had whitelisting to bypass.</p><p>My first approach was to take SSRF from <a href=https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Request%20Forgery>PayloadAllTheThings</a> and test it. I don&rsquo;t want to copy all that here. There is dozen of payloads. Sadly not of it worked. I got very interested in <a href=https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Tsai-A-New-Era-Of-SSRF-Exploiting-URL-Parser-In-Trending-Programming-Languages.pdf>Orange: A New Era SSRF</a>, but that was also death end.</p><p>I was pretty puzzled. Having high hope on some nice bug, but it looked like this service was secured. Good thing was that I have learned a lot, especially from Orange paper.</p><p>Next day with fresh head I took different way. During recon I have noted two other domains connected with main one: <code>www.example.net</code> and <code>www.example.com</code>. It turn out that those domains where also whitelisted. Having a background in programming I knew that developers have a tendency to write &ldquo;nice code&rdquo;, so maybe they used regex to check domain suffix? And guess what? They did! For request:</p><p><code>https://api.example.org/image-converter/width=100/https://www-example.org</code></p><p>I got response:</p><figure><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17719543/139577185-1b2711fb-6a19-435e-8bd3-015deb803884.png></figure><p>Hurray!</p><p>What exactly regex they usedÂ ? I think something like this regex101:</p><figure><img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17719543/139577198-3c7995e4-d9ef-4c83-ad57-2608c17305ed.png></figure><p>And what they should use is: <code>www\.example\.(com|net|org)</code></p><p>Next I have registered <code>www-example.com</code> domain and started playing with escalation this. More about it in part 2.</p><hr><p>Thanks for reading!
