Deep dive into it for Go language.
From OWASP:
Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system.
Input validation should happen as early as possible in the data flow, preferably as soon as the data is received from the external party.
Data from all potentially untrusted sources should be subject to input validation, including not only Internet-facing web clients but also backend feeds over extranets, from suppliers, partners, vendors or regulators, each of which may be compromised on their own and start sending malformed data.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating SSRF vulnerabilities in Go.

This type of attack allows an attacker to send unauthorized requests from a vulnerable application, which can lead to data leakage, server-side request smuggling, and even full-scale remote code execution.
Basic example of SSRF in Go Let&amp;rsquo;s see basic code that introduce this vulnerability:</description></item></channel></rss>
