Let&amp;rsquo;s check results and find out which performed best.
This quote from Ethan Mollick, who is professor at The Wharton School, resonates very much with my experience on LLMs. Answers from GPT look like someone tried to satisfy question in the easiest way possible üòè You can overcome that by asking for explanation or step-by-step thinking.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging LLMs for Threat Modeling - GPT-3.5</title><link>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/leveraging-llms-for-threat-modelling-gpt-3.5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 18:59:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://xvnpw.github.io/posts/leveraging-llms-for-threat-modelling-gpt-3.5/</guid><description>In this article, I delve into the AI Nutrition-Pro experiment, a research project exploring the potential of LLMs in enhancing security practices during the design phase of DevSecOps: threat modeling and security review.
DevSecOps: A Brief Overview DevSecOps merges the principles of development, security, and operations to create a culture of shared responsibility for software security. The three main goals of DevSecOps are:
